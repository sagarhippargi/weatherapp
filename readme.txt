This project is a single page web app using Django which is a python web framework 

for fetching the weather information of a place I used the open weather map API and I have used the key provided to me through email 

for the autocomplete feature I used Jqeury autocomplete feature and used that along with javascript as mentioned 

the web page has minimal css and frontend and focuses more about the autocomplete feature and handling json data 

for the autocompletion I took the cities from the dataset  https://datahub.io/core/world-cities#data 

I downloaded the json version and then I used python to get the list of cities into a file  and the code is mentioned in codeweatherapp/static/js/autocomplete.js
